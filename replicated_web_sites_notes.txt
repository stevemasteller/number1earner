We'll have to choose a same plain clean background for the 7 pages that currently don't have a background. Also because we're not initially going to be offering the custom 
 sub-domain with automatically generated replicated mini-websites just take out 
 Page #8 Be NUMBER1EARNER.COM and adjust the number order for the rest of the pages.

God bless.
